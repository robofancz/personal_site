    <h1>Skills in programming</h1><br>
    <h2>Python</h2>
    <p>Python is the Language I have been using the longest.</p>
    <p>I like to believe that I am somewhat proficient when it comes to the language.</p><br>
    <h2>html</h2>
    <p>I have only recently started learning html so I am not as proficient.</p>
    <p>However with the progress I am making every day it should not be long before I have to a point mastered it.</p>
    <p>Also visible from this site since I made it from scratch :].</p><br>
    <h2>css</h2>
    <p>CSS is a new language for me however I am making progress bit by bit</p><br>
    <h2>Java Script</h2>
    <p>This site is my first attempt at using JS what so ever so it will be imprefect and sometimes lacking however I am eager to improve.</p><br>
    <h2>C#</h2>
    <p>C# is yet another new language for me that I started discovering this year.</p>
    <p>So far I am able to make simple windows form applications and simple console applications</p>
